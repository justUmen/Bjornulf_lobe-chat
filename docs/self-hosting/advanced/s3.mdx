# Configuring S3 Storage Service

LobeChat has supported multimodal AI conversations since [a long time ago](https://x.com/lobehub/status/1724289575672291782), which involves the function of uploading images to AI. In the client-side database solution, image files are stored as binary data directly in the browser's IndexedDB database. However, this solution is not feasible in the server-side database. Storing file-like data directly in Postgres would greatly waste database storage space and slow down computational performance.

The best practice in this area is to use a file storage service (S3) to store image files. S3 is also the storage solution on which the file upload/knowledge base function depends.

<Callout type={'info'}>
In this documentation, S3 refers to a compatible S3 storage solution, which supports the Amazon S3 API for object storage systems. Common examples include Cloudflare R2, Alibaba Cloud OSS, and self-deployable Minio, all of which support the S3 compatible API.

Currently, the S3 configuration tutorials included in the documentation are:
